/*
Lowest Common Ancestor
Given the root node of a binary tree and two distinct values, find the lowest common ancestor.

Input:     Root Node, Two Integer Values
Output:  Integer Value of Lowest Common Ancestor
Example
         5
        /  \
       2    7
          /   \
        4       8
                  \
                    9

  Input: root, 4, 9
  Output: 7

Constraints
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(N)

Integer values of nodes are all distinct.
